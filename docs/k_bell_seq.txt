## 2019-10-15
shots 795 and 796 regained bragg driffraction I had miss judge trap switch off
currently achieving bragg difraction c:\remote\settings201915Oct112216.xml
keysight trig at 23.455, trap switch off at ~23.459
attempting to see some halos (803-815)
zero detuning (816-982)

# attempting to achieve equal state splitting among k=-1,0,+1
set detuning to be zero, i.e. dF_Bragg_src=0;
short time (3 mus) high power (0.5) produces side orders and has the most pop in k=0
side orders begin to die off around 10 mus

# going to move position of bragg to after trap switch off
doing so causes many more diffraction order to appear (see shot 987-988 for 3ms diffraction after trap switch off, 989-990 for 2ms, 991-992 for 1ms, and 993-994 for at trap switch off [well just slightly before])
moving back to 1 ms before trap switch off (see 997 - 998 for reference)
13mus pulse no longer has side modes though transfer greatly decreased (999-1000)
11 mus pulse have slight side modes but transfer is ok (1001 - 1002)
halfing the power of the pulse (to 0.25) seems to equalize the state transfer (and remove side modes) though k=+/-1 is much smaller than k=0 (1003-4)
reducing pulse length with smaller power (0.25 and 9 mus) increases state transfer while keeping side modes suppresed (1005-1006)
reducing evap (-20kHz) to remove saturation and see how populations compare
still saturating reducing another 20 kHz (again 20 kHz)
10 kHz up (from what I can see fairly equal transfer 0.25 and 7 mus)
back up 30 kHz (back up 20 kHz)
optimal parameters (T=7.8e-6,K=0.26,Gs=2)

will attempt in trap state rotation
with raman activating in trap but no kick yet 1037
with kick activating 1ms after trap switch off (1038 to 1039 nuller was on during kick, 1040 1060 nuller off and kick activating properly, can't see a difference)
kick without in trap transfer 1063 (still no noticble effect)
1069 kick activating (slight shift in z)
increasing raman power to see if there is transfer (1075)
achieved state transfer by removing bragg from keysight (1079)

Bragg laser (1550 nm) remained on the whole night with power remaining stable
moving keysight trig 3 ms after trap switch off

## 2019-10-17
current settings: c:\remote\settings201917Oct122440.xml
switching to old settings to understand why i can't move bec with push coils
getting some movement in the bec, will try to get the two peaks back (reducing bragg 1226)
seeing two peak (1226) but not well separated, increasing kick (1227), c:\remote\settings201917Oct124413.xml
removing first push coil (1228) greatly increased separation of the clouds, reference for no push (1229)
(1230) testin shorter kick, (1231) even shrt kick
transporting over to setting with nuller in them (current:c:\remote\settings201917Oct125550.xml, swap:c:\remote\settings201917Oct125907.xml)
another no kick ref (1236)
moving keysight to after trap switch off (1238), almost no transger

Attmepting to get transfer with RF antenna (note detuning/ bias in trap is 3.5 MHz)

Ajusted polarisation and alignment (see 1853 to 1880)

Introduced a time delay variable (unsure if implementation is optimal)

adjusted nuller and alignment (again) 380 in the mj=1 state is the number to beat (~79.8% transfer)
going param by param optimise to see what we can get

trying with chebwin 6.29e-6

knocked synth down (60 kHz)

messing around with keysight trigger time (23.462)

 Noticed the nuller seems to be pushing the condensate through the evap
 ramp point was 3.56 moved it 3.58
 not enough moving final point to 3.62
 moving the synth doesn't seem to help, will try just turning it off
 that did get rid of it

 going to just leave it in for now , settings : c:\remote\settings201921Oct161725.xml
 nuller was switching at 23.468 now switching off at 23.464
